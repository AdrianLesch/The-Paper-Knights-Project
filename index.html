            <p>Do you love to immerse yourself in imaginary worlds, create memorable characters, and experience
                thrilling adventures? If so, you might be interested in joining our pen and paper roleplaying club!
                We are a group of enthusiasts who meet regularly to play tabletop role-playing games (TRPGs). <br><br>
                TRPGs are games in which you and your friends take on the roles of fictional characters and collaborate
                to
                tell a story. You can choose from a variety of genres, such as fantasy, science fiction, horror, or
                historical, and use dice and rules to determine the outcomes of your actions. <br><br>
                If you are interested, please use our <a href="#contactForm">contact form</a> down below for more
                information. We hope to see you soon at our next session!</p>

                updates
                on our upcoming events and workshops, as well as other announcements and information. </p>

            <h4>Events</h4> <br>
            <p>We have some exciting events planned for the next few months, and we hope you can join us for some
                fun
                and adventure!</p><br>
            <ul>
                <li>April 10, 2023: We are hosting a one-shot session of Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition at "The George &
                    Dragon".
                    A one-shot is a standalone adventure that can be completed in one session, without any prior
                    commitment
                    or character creation. It’s a great way to try out a new game or system, or to introduce someone
                    to the
                    hobby. The session will start at 6 pm and last for about 3 hours. We have space for 8 players,
                    and the
                    game will be run by our experienced dungeon master, Alex. If you are interested, please sign up
                    <a href="#contactForm">here</a>
                    by April 8, 2023.

                <li>
                    May 5, 2023: We are organizing a game night at "The George & Dragon". This is a casual and social
                    event where
                    you can meet other members of the club, play some board games or card games, or just chat and
                    have a
                    drink. The game night will start at 8 pm and end at 11 pm. There is no need to register, just
                    show up
                    and have fun!

                <li>
                    June 17, 2023: We are participating in the Free RPG Day at "Warhammer". Free RPG Day
                    is an
                    annual event where game publishers and retailers offer free samples of their products, such as
                    rulebooks, modules, dice, or miniatures. It’s a great opportunity to discover new games, get
                    some
                    freebies, and support your local game store. We will be there from 10 am to 6 pm, and we will be
                    running
                    some demo sessions of various TRPGs, such as Call of Cthulhu, Cyberpunk Red, Star Wars, and
                    more. If you
                    want to join us, please check the schedule <a href="#">here</a> and sign up for the sessions you

            <h4>Workshops</h4> <br>
            <p>We also have some workshops planned for the next few months, where you can learn new skills or
                improve
                your existing ones. These workshops are open to anyone who wants to learn more about TRPGs, whether
                you
                are a beginner or an expert.</p><br>

            <ul>
                <li>April 24, 2023: We are offering a workshop on character creation at "The George & Dragon". Character
                    creation
                    is one of the most important and enjoyable aspects of TRPGs, as it allows you to express your
                    creativity
                    and personality through your character. In this workshop, you will learn how to create a
                    character for
                    any TRPG system, using some basic steps and guidelines. You will also learn how to write a
                    character
                    background, choose a character class and race, assign attributes and skills, and select
                    equipment and
                    abilities. The workshop will start at 2 pm and last for about 2 hours. We have space for 12
                    participants, and the workshop will be led by our experienced player, Lisa. If you are
                    interested,
                    please sign up <a href="#contactForm">here</a> by April 22, 2023.

                <li>
                    May 19, 2023: We are offering a workshop on game mastering at "Warhammer". Game mastering is
                    one of
                    the most challenging and rewarding roles in TRPGs, as it involves creating and running the game
                    world,
                    the story, and the non-player characters. In this workshop, you will learn how to be a good game
                    master
                    for any TRPG system, using some tips and tricks. You will also learn how to prepare and
                    improvise a game
                    session, design and balance encounters, create and portray NPCs, and handle different situations
                    and
                    player styles. The workshop will start at 2 pm and last for about 3 hours. We have space for 10
                    participants, and the workshop will be led by our experienced game master, Alex. If you are
                    interested,
