# The Paper-Knights-Project

I created this website for the "Responsive Club-Website"-Challenge-Project of the Codecademy Fullstack Engineer Career Path.
This scope was to use the up until then learned skills of HTML and CSS and create a responsive Website for a fictional club.
I decided to go with a Pen&Paper-Rollplaying Club and planned and created all of the content. Pictures were created with an AI.

## Here is the original project scope from the Codecademy-Website:

### Overview
​This project is slightly different than others you have encountered thus far on Codecademy. Instead of a step-by-step tutorial, this project contains a series of open-ended requirements which describe the project you’ll be building. There are many possible ways to correctly fulfill all of these requirements, and you should expect to use the Internet, Codecademy, and other resources when you encounter a problem that you cannot easily solve.​

### Project Goals
In this project, you’ll be building your own club group page that will dynamically respond as you adjust the size of your screen!​
